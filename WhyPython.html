<h2> Why use Python?</h2>
<img src="PythonSelection.jpg" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 400px;">
<p>the popularity isn't the only reason why alot of people continue using it.
<br>
Technologies like Java, C# and C++ are often used in automation.
Still, Python has a lot of benefits that make it an go-to option.
<br>
<br>
<b>Python is easy to learn.</b>
<br>
<br>
The simple syntax makes Python the best programming language to learn from scratch.
Besides, you can find a bunch of useful materials on the web. It has readable code.
<br>
Python code is easy to understand.
It is convenient for scripting and supported by numerous tools.
<br>
<br>
<b>Python is an (almost) universal language.</b>
<br>
<br>
Python is a general-purpose language that can solve a vast array of tasks.
It is used in web and desktop apps, data analytics, scripting, etc. It enhances team productivity.
<br>
<br>
<b>Python is concise</b>
<br>
<br>
Where Python needs one line of code, Java uses ten lines,
so it allows solving more tasks with fewer lines of code, leaving precious time to deal with more complex tasks.
<br>
<br>
<b>Community Support</b>
<br>
<br>
The community is your backup. Massive code libraries help you save time.
You don’t have to reinvent the wheel but use ready code for import.
To ease their development timings,
most developers rely on Python libraries and frameworks.
In a software library, there are already pre-written codes that the developers look up to solve programming challenges.
This is where Python’s pre-existing set of libraries play a major role in providing the set of libraries and frameworks to choose from.
<br>
<br>
While it would take much longer to fully understand how Python works, some tasks can be automated with simple Python code.
