<h2>Python and SEO Automation</h2>
<img src="trends.jpg" alt="missing" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 400px;">
<p>The reason that Python makes an excellent tool for SEO automation is that it's easy to learn
and comes with some pre-built libraries that are perfect for automating certain SEO tasks.
For small businesses, that means finding someone with the necessary expertise to do the job is easy
and there's very little code customization needed.
And by using Python to automate the following tasks, the most labor-intensive parts of the SEO process can be left on auto-pilot.
One of the key ways that businesses can improve their site's SEO is to create content that's in demand by their target audience.
But doing that requires staying on top of search trends to see when a particular topic is hot and when it's not.
With Python and the handy PyTrends unofficial Google Trends API,
it's a simple matter to automate keyword tracking and produce interest reports.
Those make it possible to create timely content that suits current search demands.
It not only saves the costs involved in conventional keyword tracking but also optimizes content creation
to create high-engagement pages that drive positive SEO

<p>Python is used for automated file management – creating, deleting, renaming, and other file operations.
A handful of Python scripts can perform full-blown file management operations automatically or at a scheduled time
Python scripts are used to perform file management operations,
either on the same filesystem or remotely.

<p>Filling up online forms can be tiring,
but what should you do when you have to fill thousands of similar forms?
The best way is to write a relevant Python script for that particular form and let it fill all the forms automatically.
</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Python is used to fill up online forms automatically.</li>
<li>Any suitable Python script can extract data from a file and fill an equivalent online form.</li>
<li>You can automate filling up online forms like Google forms or other sign-up / login forms.</li>
<li>Using vanilla Python scripts, forms can be submitted without any user interference.</li>
</ol>

<p>Python is often used in workplaces to automate and schedule the sending/receiving of emails and texts.
Python packages – email, smtplib, are used for sending emails using just Python.
You can turn a time-consuming task into an automated/scheduled task.
Emails and texts are usually automated or scheduled , among other tasks within a team,to focus on further development tasks.
This increases productivity and encourages better time management in a group.
