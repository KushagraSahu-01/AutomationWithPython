<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Human beings don't like performing the same tasks over and over,we tend to find them inconvenient and boring.
We like to do challenging and complex things that make us develop our skills.
We don't like to do the same things over and over again, generally speaking.
Doing repetitive tasks Limits Our productivity.
<br>
<br>
This is one of the best examples of the beneficial uses of computers.
Using Python,
we can automate repetitive tasks in an effective way.

<p>To start approaching automation with Python,
we'll have to understand two things first: what automation is, and what Python is.
<br>
<br>
<b>Automation:</b> a process in which a manually performed action is transformed into one that happens automatically.
<br>
<br>
<b>Python:</b> a versatile programming language that’s relatively easy to learn and use,
thanks to its resemblance to the English language and it’s open-source licensing.
<br>
<br>
There are a huge range of tasks that you might opt to automate by writing Python scripts.
Python users can use their creativity to create innovative automated solutions for the 
boring stuff they encounter in their daily life.
